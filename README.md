Many years ago I the infamous [Sound of Sorting](https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/) video and I wanted to replicate it myself. I knew a little bit of SDL GUI programming and started on this project. I never got sound working as I hadnt had much experience with SDL sound library, but my add it if I ever revisit this project.
